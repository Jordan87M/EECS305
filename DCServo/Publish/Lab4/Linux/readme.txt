Hi. The DCservo model for Lab 4 is a little bit different than that for Lab 2. 
A simulated supply voltage limits the maximum control effort. The Lab 2 
version of the model had a limit that was lower than I intended, so it's been
increased for the Lab 4 model. I've also changed the default style of the 
scope plots to be more printer friendly. Sorry about any inconvenience that
the old settings might have caused.
